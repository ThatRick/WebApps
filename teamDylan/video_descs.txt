Title: RAMPAGE FINAL PRACTICE DAY

Description:
Red Bull Rampage final day of practice In this video from Team Stark. We have our last day of practice before the biggest event in freeride mountain biking happens. We start the morning off getting the quarter pipe dialed while it was still too windy to ride the upper section. Once the wind mellowed out I headed up to test out the features at the very top of my line which scared me the most due to the gnarly exposure. After making some changes to one of the drops I did a few runs on the upper portion of my line. Lots of people were unlocking their whole runs this day and getting ready for the big day on Sunday. We called it early that day before it got too late and decided to get rest for the early morning of event day. Make sure to cheer on Team Stark on the Redbull Rampage Live Stream as I compete against the best mountain bikers in the world.

Red Bull Rampage Practice Day 2 In this video Team Stark heads to Red Bull Rampage for our second day of practice. We start off by dodging Rampage crew trying to find the rail, luckily that defused quickly and turns out they were rad. I head up to test my mid line section that I haven't rode yet. Did a few laps on that and watched the other riders test out their features as well. Didn't get to much riding or digging done because we got there so late due to the Womens Rampage that day. Only one more day of practice left before the big event and still need to ride the top of my line.

Red Bull Rampage Dig Day 7 We start off dig day 7 waking up on time for once and then it started raining super hard out of nowhere right before we headed out to the venue. Then we got a message that the roads into the venue are closed until it dries out. We wait a little bit then head up to the staging parking lot where we sit for about 2 hours. The weather never let up so we headed up to Old Site to link up with our homie Dan that was camping out there. We sesh the pit bike track in the camp grounds. Once it started raining more we figured that we werent gonna be able to make it into the venue so we headed to lunch at River Rock Cafe. We ran into Big Priv and the YT industries homies at lunch. After that we decided to head out to Zion to check it out while the government is shut down because its free entrance during the shut down. We busted out the RC crawlers and had a good time racing and crawling the hills there. Ended the day cruising around Zion and hanging out at home. Not the dig day we expected but it was a good rest day that we all needed.

Also lots of people stop by our dig site to hang out and todays guest start was Big Priv, also the YT industries squad pulled up to support the riders in the event. Only a few more days left until the big event day and some more weather in the forecast.

red bull rampage dig day 5 In this episode of Team Stark at Red Bull rampage. We start off by sneaking T Dawg into the event past all the security. Lots of guest stars swing by like Rob Warner, Josh Bender and many more. Since it was the first day of men's practice more people were showing up to watch. The venue is changing each day as the contest day approaches. Marky falls in love with a fan at lunch then forgets her name. The boys get on the ropes and slap in the biggest landing of our line and we pushed thru with the unreal dirt conditions trying to finish up the line. Much more to come each day. #redbullbike (https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/redbullbike)#redbullrampage (https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/redbullrampage)#teamstark (https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/teamstark) Music Link: ![Image 61 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Lk9uE_gZk)/whole-lotta-weed](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqa1hMQWVhMmZuTG5oTkxxdlFDdEFsSlNMdDhqd3xBQ3Jtc0tsR1J4UWoyTWhtMVdaLXJ2NWZ1YTZFdFZlcWhNajRIQmpSX2pQRGNTZ19BUmNEYUhiV1ZVSFNHX2tTUnl3YXVEemVMUXhRaVFodzNiMlBuZElrUzdMSXAxdnF1bGJUOW4zeHNoQkVCWF9YTVNlZ1Vidw&q=https%3A%2F%2Fsoundcloud.com%2Fwestmane%2Fwhole-lotta-weed&v=33Lk9uE_gZk)

Red Bull Rampage Dig day 4 In this video of digging at Red Bull Rampage, We start our day 4 of digging after another storm came in last night and soaked the venue. Unreal dirt conditions but we got a late start like always. Being the last team there and first to leave everyday. Lots of building of the biggest landings in my line and trying to get stuff ridable for practice day coming up. But since we bought rc crawlers it was very distracting and we wanted to spend more time crawling than digging. Bender stopped by for his daily hang out and then Syzmon came by and told us we should finish his line for him. Lots of jokes and good times while working away to get this line ready for the big day.

Red Bull Rampage Rest Day 2025 In this video we enjoy our rest day, after a huge storm we had to switch our rest day to a day earlier than scheduled. It was much needed because we've been digging hard the first 3 days. Now with a rest day we are able to get some stuff done like go buy RC crawlers and go to costco to get more food for the upcoming week. Once we found a store that had crawlers we went back to the house which has the best crawler course set up in the backyard. The homie Colin came over with Team Slovakia and hung out with a special guest Bender. We watched the world premiere of Rampage Dig Day 3. To finish up the video we headed up to Old Site to get some time on my bike and get it all dialed in before we head to the final dig day before practice.

Red Bull Rampage Dig Day 3 In this video of red bull rampage dig day 3, We start the morning finishing editing the previous day video and getting it uploaded then we have a late start because of a small rain storm causing the road to be closed into the venue. Once they opened the road we headed up to go dig, Team Stark is always last to show up and first to leave. On the way up we saw Syzmon Godziek and he was too busy on another feature to help us so team Stark had a lot of work cut out for the day. It took us all day to get this landing to the feature finished. This landing was very crucial to our line because without it we can't get to our lower section. Right before the sun set we finished the landing and got to work on the next jump. Lots of digging and more messing around while digging to keep the vibes up. Even special guest Josh Bender stopping by for some motivation.

Red Bull Rampage Scout Day 2025 In this video we head to Red Bull Rampage in Utah, This is the first day which is scout day. The team heads into this years venue to walk the mountain and look for what lines they will be building. I have never been to this venue before so it was new to me and as well as my whole team, watching the live broadcast does not do justice to the amount of exposure the venue has. We walked around for hours and think we figured out what line I will be choosing. But we are doing something nobody has done before, we are letting the commenters decide on what features we will build. So comment below on what you think I should build for my Red Bull Rampage run.

Stark Land Build Video #2 I this video we start off at my old trail spot where I would host my annual 4/20 jams, But since I've moved away I didn't want to leave the huge wood ramp there to be destroyed and would have much more use for it at my new house. So Shane and I headed there and took it apart to transport it back to my new house where we rebuilt it even better and with a bigger gap. Now that the ramp has much more speed from the hill coming into it we were able to build it a lot bigger. But when building jumps this big it takes a lot of dirt. Thanks to Equipment Share Temecula for another tractor rental right after we got a random rain storm making the dirt very good to work with. I had to waste no time and make the best use of the wet dirt. About 1 day in the tractor and the landing got beefed up and was able to start doing test runs. A few days after getting the ramp going we headed out to Kawasaki USA headquarters to pick up a brand new Mule. Kawasaki is a dream sponsor of mine because it was located in my home town and now they are supporting me for Red Bull Rampage this year and helping out at Stark Land so much with the Kawasaki Mule Ranch Edition. Dreams do come true! With less than a week away from heading out to Rampage I decided to take it easy and just get all the stuff ready and let my body rest before heading into such a labor extensive event.

Title: STARK LAND First Build At The New Property!

Description:
Sep 25 2025

Stark Land The First Build This is the first build at my new house, I recently moved and wasted no time building out my new property. With Red Bull Rampage approaching fast I wanted to build something I can practice on at home. I started the first project with a bunch of friends building a big mountain bike drop, luckily I was able to get help from a heavy equipment rental coming called Equipment Share and they sponsored this build with a skid steer rental and a water trailer. Thanks to Austyn at Temecula Equipment Share for helping us because without this I would never been able to get this done in time. Lots of trips to Home Depot for lumber and with help from all the homies we were able to get this build finished in one weekend. Stay tuned for more videos as I build out my new house into southern California’s best Mtb training grounds. Thanks for watching and subscribe for more!

Red Bull Rampage 2025 Invited Rider In this video I take you into what I have been up too since I received the invite to Red Bull Rampage 2025. This has been a different approach to this years Rampage than I was expecting. Now being a recent dad and having to juggle moving houses right before the biggest event of the year comes up is no easy task. While doing all of that I was able to get out and film this video to give some insight to my training schedule. Luckily I live in a location where I've been able to build the perfect training grounds. I take you to some of my local zones and show you how I train. Thanks to Anderson Ta and Tyson Traner for helping film this video. Huge thanks to SPANK Industries for helping me keep going with rad wheels and parts.

Building A Redbull Rampage Submission MTB Line This is what it took me to build one of the lines from my recent Rampage Submission Video for 2025. I wanted to document the process to show how much effort really goes into these type of builds, Middle of summer peak heat wave and with a deadline I tried to get as much built as I could while being a new dad and having to watch my son during the day until Brittany gets off work then I would go dig until dark once the heat started to chill out. This was a hectic build due to having a deadline approaching fast, Luckily I was able to get it all done just in time to turn it in. If you enjoy these type of videos make sure to watch the second build video of another line I built for this video project.

Dylan Stark Rampage Video Submission 2025 #starkforrampage (https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/starkforrampage) 2 Here's my Redbull Rampage Submission video for 2025 sponsored by Spank Industries. This year I hope to get invited back to Rampage so I filmed a video to go with my application to compete. Its a hard process to get in but hopefully this will help my chances. 18 days of digging mostly alone and 2 days of filming in the middle of summer during a heat wave in the Inland Empire of California. I built by hand some of the craziest features I could find and build in the time frame of this video deadline. This whole video was edited in less than 24 hours to make the application deadline.

Mountain High Bike Park Grand Opening Mountain High has been around for over 100 years and they just now opened up summer operations for mountain biking. The mountain has built 2 trails, Coyote Creek and Lil Pines. A blue and green trail with talk of building a new black trail with jumps coming soon. This was opening day and I was stoked for a new Chair lift access bike park in southern California. Mt high was set to open last fall right before the wildfires almost burnt down the resort forcing them to not open last season and wait until Summer 2025. Excited to see what this place could put together with proper built features, the terrain is there just needs to be built up. I'll check back with an update video later this summer and see the progress of this brand new bike park.

Snow Summit Bike Park Opening Day 2025 In this video I head to my local bike park that has helped me become the rider I am today. Snow Summit Bike Park located in Big Bear California has opened for the 2025 mountain bike season on June 6th and I was up there for opening day to see the new trail improvements they did for this season. The trail crew has been working hard to make opening day happen and they were able to add some new features to a existing trail called Blue Steel and they gave some much needed love to a lot of other trails to get everything ready for the season. This videos shows the new features and then I hosted group rides with YT Industries each day and had a huge group of groms and shredders participate in party laps.

Title: E-MTB Street Spots In San Diego
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0hiwmbtHp0
Description:
Jun 1 2025

Electric Mountain Biking around San Diego California In this video we head down to La Jolla beach to pedal around the SDSU campus on our electric mountain bikes, I met up with my homie Jake and we are both on YT Industries Decoy's. Electric bikes are great for exploring street spots because you can cover so much ground and have such a fun time just jibbing on random stuff you normally wouldn't ride on a bmx or skateboard. We checked out the campus and some of La Jolla area. This was just a scout mission for a video project I'm working on but I figured I would do a POV riding video of the day because something interesting always happens.

Title: SHEEP HILLS BOOZER MEMORIAL JAM 2025

Description:
May 25 2025

Sheep Hills Boozer Memorial Jam 2025 In this video I head to Costa Mesa California to the oldest dirt jump spot still going to this day, This is one of the very first spots where dirt jumping was invented and is still going 30+ years later. This jam was once a fund raiser for Mike "Boozer" Brown that became a memorial jam for him and a few other Sheep Hills Locals including Ricky Ratt, Bryant Dubon, and The FIDS. Each year the locals host this to raise money for the local bmx community. I grew up coming to Sheep Hills and its always been a staple in the Socal Scene. I arrived just before the Best Trick contest started and rode with a few other local pros like Tucker Smith, Mike Hucker Clark and Andy Buckworth to name a few. Everyone was throwing down and having a good time, Lots of groms shredding the smaller jumps as well. If you're in Socal around May next year come out to the jam and show some love and support!

Description:
Apr 26 2025

The Last 420 Jump Jam Video This years 4/20 Easter Jump Jam was the 6th one I've thrown at my local jumps, But it will be the last one I host at this location. Every year this event gets bigger and bigger and I really want to expand to a new location (still searching) and have the best dirt jump event in Southern California. This event is already the only BMX and MTB dirt event with prizes that is open invite and we don't judge on what you ride. During this jam we held a Best Trick contest, Highest Air contest and a Rider of the day award. Every year the jumps get bigger and this year was the biggest the jumps have been making it extra gnarly for those sending the jumps. Many wheels were destroyed and lots of crashes but overall very good times. Thanks to our sponsors Only Fire, Pit Viper and Day Trip for supporting the event with tons of prizes. Huge shout out to Dallas at Enuffglass for making custom trophies for the prizes and really setting the bar high for 420 trophies in years to come. Such a good day with tons of riding, hanging out and having MTB legend Josh Bender announce the event was the cherry on top. If you missed out this year this is your warning to make it to the next one. Hopefully next year we will have a new location with camping and more events! Don't miss the best dirt jump event of the year! Thanks for watching and Subscribe for more videos!

Natural ZEALECTION Part 2 In this video we continue the New Zealand trip for Natural Selection, The video starts off with more practice days on the course where more misfortune happens and 2 more riders get airlifted out causing the practice days to be cut short. We end up driving a few hours to the south part of New Zealand to help a fellow rider Barb Edwards and Asa Howe when a crash happened and they were flown to a hospital far away and we took them their belongings and rental car so they weren't stranded. After that we checked out the most nearby southern point of New Zealand and put our feet in the ocean and checked out the tide pools before heading back to Queenstown.The next day at practice I took a heavy crash and was airlifted to the nearby hospital for scans and treatment, Luckily nothing too serious and was released later that day but sadly ended my chance to compete in Natural Selection Bike. On contest day I was able to make it out to watch and cheer on Kurtis Downs and the other riders. This was a crazy trip and didn't end how I was hoping it would but was still a great time with 2 of my good friends Tyson Traner and Kurtis Downs.

Natural Zealection Part 1 This video we head to the other side of the world to New Zealand. I take a trip with 2 good friends Kurtis Downs and Tyson Traner for 10 days. I rented an RV for the trip so we could see more of the country and get the full experience. We spent our days checking out Gorge Road Bike park which has been a bucket list location of mine, sadly I didn't bring the right bike but was able to borrow a friends and do some laps. We went to another amazing riding area called Dream Track and it truly was a dream but our session was cut short and we didn't get to ride there much. After that we head to the contest we traveled all the way there to be at. Natural Selection Bike is the event we were competing in, In this video we do a course walk seeing the freshly built masterpiece built by the locals just for this event. The jumps were huge and very technical but so much fun. At the end of the video we do the first practice day which was cut short due to a rider getting hurt then the wind picked up making it not ridable for the day.
