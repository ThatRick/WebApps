# WebApps

This repository hosts quick one-off prototypes. The root `index.html` is auto-generated by `scripts/updateLandingPage.js` to list discovered prototypes so the landing page always reflects the latest additions. The generated landing page is permanently tuned for dark modeâ€”no toggles, just vibes.

## Updating the landing page

Run the following whenever you add or rename a prototype:

```bash
node scripts/updateLandingPage.js
```

The script scans immediate subdirectories for HTML entry points. If a folder contains an `index.html`, the folder itself is linked; otherwise, every HTML file is listed individually.

## Automatic deployment

A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) regenerates the landing page and publishes the repository to GitHub Pages whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch. You can also trigger the workflow manually from the Actions tab via the `workflow_dispatch` event.
