# Agent Guidelines

- Always identify which prototype the task concerns. Prototype directories live at the repository root (for example `boxbuilder/`, `teamDylan/`, etc.).
- Navigate into the matching prototype folder before editing files and inspect any local documentation.
- Look for a `README.md` (both in the repo root and inside the prototype directory) for build/run instructions, design notes, or constraints before changing code.
- Apply any additional `AGENTS.md` instructions you find in subdirectoriesâ€”they override this file for their scope.
